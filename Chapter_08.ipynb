The chapter is of great importance as causal inference relies heavily on these assumptions and not meeting them might lead to biased results. We discuss positivity and exchangeability assumptions. Next, we discuss other assumptions. In the last part of the chapter we focus on unobserved variables and discuss them from yet another angle."
